react-router-dispatcher is designed to work with [react-router v4.x](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router), it:
  * invokes static methods of _route components_ before rendering
  * requires using [react-router-config v4.x](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/tree/master/packages/react-router-config) route configuration
  * supports server-side rendering.

#### Looking for **version 1.x**??
>[You can find it on the _V1_ branch](https://github.com/adam-26/react-router-dispatcher/tree/v1).
Version 2 has been simplified and **no longer requires [redux](redux.js.org)**


### Install
```sh
// npm
npm install --save react-router-dispatcher

// yarn
yarn add react-router-dispatcher
```

### Usage

##### server-side rendering

If your building a universal application, use the `createRouteDispatcher` factory method to
create the `<RouteDispatcher>` component that is used to render on **both** the server and client.

```js
import { createRouteDispatcher } from 'react-router-dispatcher';

// === Params ===
// The current request url, for expressjs use request.url
const location = request.url;
// route configuration, using react-router-config configuration
const routes = [...];
const options = {
  // static method(s) to invoke - defaults to 'loadData'
  dispatchActions: [['loadData']],
  // passed to all static action methods
  helpers: { apiClient }
};

// Use the createRouteDispatcher factory, it returns a component and method for server-side rendering
const { RouteDispatcher, dispatchOnServer } = createRouteDispatcher(location, routes, options);

dispatchOnServer().then(() => {
  // render your application here
  // Use the <RouteDispatcher /> component created by the factory method to render your app,
  // this <RouteDispatcher /> will NOT invoke static action methods on initial load on the client
});

```

##### client-only rendering

If your application does not use server-side rendering, use the exported `<RouteDispatcher>` component
to render your application.

```js
import { RouterDispatcher } from 'react-router-dispatcher';

// render your app

```

### Defining actions

>You **must define actions on route components** (components that are assigned directly to react-router-config style routes)

An action is simply a **static method** defined on a component. Its _recommended_ that you return a **Promise** from the static action method.

```js
export default class MyComponent extents React.Component {

  static loadData = (match, helpers) => {
    const {params, isExact, path, url} = match; // match from react-router
    return Promise.resolve(helpers.api.loadData(params.id));
  };

  // ...render, etc.
}
```

The same can be achieved using stateless components

```js
const MyComponent = (props) => {
	// render here
};

MyComponent.loadData = (match, helpers) => {
	return Promise.resolve(helpers.api.loadData(match.params.id));
};
```

### Configuration options

`dispatchActions`:
Configure the **static method(s)** defined any any _route component_ to invoke before rendering.
Accepts:
  * a string, the default is `loadData` - any component with a `static loadData = (match, helpers) => {}` will be invoked before rendering
  * an array, `['loadData', 'parseData']` - all methods will be invoked in parallel before rendering
  * nested array, `[['loadData'], ['parseData']]` - each inner array will be invoked serially (ie: `loadData` will be invoked on all components, before `parseData` is invoked on all components)

`routeComponentPropNames`:
Configure the **prop** names of _route components_ that are known to be react **components**
The default value is `component`.

`helpers`:
Any value can be assigned to helpers, the value is passed to all `static action methods`, common usages include passing api clients and application state (such as a redux store)

### RouteDispatcher Props
>All configuration options can be assigned as props

`loadingComponent`:
If server-side rendering is **not** used, a _loading component_ will be displayed to the user when dispatching actions on initial load. Pass a component to customize the loading UI.

`render`:
Allows the render method to be customized, you **must** invoke the react-router `renderRoutes` method within the render method.
